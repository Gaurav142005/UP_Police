To ensure the conduct of fear-free, independent, and fair Lok Sabha elections, the UP Police can take several measures. Firstly, they should register prosecutions related to elections and discuss them as required. Immediate prosecution should be registered for related crimes within one month of completion of elections. The police should also inspect the site of incidents, prepare a map of the scene, and preserve physical evidence. 
The police should ensure that all proceedings are fulfilled, and the police report should be sent to the court only when they are satisfied with all the proceedings done by the police. The prosecution of crimes related to elections should be completed after taking cognizance by the court. A gazetted-level officer should be appointed for effective advocacy of prosecutors.
In addition to these measures, the police should identify hot spots of criminal incidents in each district and ensure effective patrolling/foot patrolling. They should also arrange for CCTV cameras at places identified for preventing crime and set up permanent police pickets at sensitive places. The police should ensure a strong patrolling system, with regular patrolling, and match their operations with crime mapping.
The police should also ensure supervision by a gazetted officer of the patrolling system and check sensitive places at night. They should monitor suspicious persons outside railway stations, bus bases, malls, and crowded places, and check suspicious vehicles and persons. The police should organize seminars to make their subordinates aware of these instructions and ensure compliance.
To maintain law and order during the electoral process, the police should activate zonal checking schemes and patrolling systems for night patrolling in each district. They should designate an officer to review the previous day's activities and take necessary action. The police should ensure effective advocates against criminals involved in heinous crimes and take concrete actions on all pending deliberations.
The police should also establish coordination with village heads and elite persons of Gram/Mohalla to curb incidents. They should install street lights on deserted and dark places and arrange for private chowkidars in city and rural areas with public cooperation. The police should ensure strict compliance with these instructions and take disciplinary action against personnel who are negligent in their duties.
